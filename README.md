## Getting Started

### Installation

2. Link to it in the HTML of your Website.
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="./headlessDetect.js"> </script>
```

3. Construct a new Headless Detector and can call the `getHeadlessScore()` Function to see the likelihood of a user using a Headless Browser and then do with it whatever you want.
```
var headlessDetector = new HeadlessDetect();

if(headlessDetector.getHeadlessScore() > 0.25){
    console.log("Headless Browser detected");
}
```
